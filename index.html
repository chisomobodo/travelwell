            <p class="content">"Just wanted to let you know that the trip was fantastic and everything worked out seamlessly! <br> The hotels and the tours you recommended were excellent! Hotel locations in particular were ideal. <br> Alessio came through as promised with the Christmas Eve mass tickets, and that experience was very special for us. <br> Also, the Trip Plan app made things very easy for us. It was nice that we could all check out the daily plan at any time, <br> and be able to pull up all the vouchers and tickets." -Margie K.</p>
